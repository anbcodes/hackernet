# Hackernet

A new internet for hackers.

## Goals

- To create a seperate internet on top of the existing internet
- To build internet protocols from the ground up
- To have fun!

## Purpose

There really isn't a purpose other than its fun to build stuff, and I wanted to
see how hard it would be to rebuild the basics of the internet.

> Also by "hackers" I mean the curious people who like to mess around with
> technology, not Cybersecurity.
