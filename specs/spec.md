# Hackernet Spec

Ultimately, Hackernet runs on top of any communication protocol that can send
bits. The main transport right now is UDP, but there is no reason to not use
something like websockets or even physical wires.

You can find the different protocols below

- [Routing Protocol](/routing.md)
- Name Protocol
- Transport Protocol
- Document Protocol
- Application Protocol
